# mcgill-notes
These are notes from some of the courses I've taken. I put in a lot of effort into them, and it paid off. With the exception of MATH 240, I received an A in all of these courses. It felt like a shame to let these notes rot in a landfill, so I'm sharing them publicly in case they can be helpful to someone else too -- content-wise or as inspiration for how to structure study notes!

A caveat: they're mostly handwritten - no time to type them up sorry - but I think they're legible enough!
