# mcgill-notes
These are notes from some of the courses I've taken. I put a lot of effort into these notes, and it's paid off (As for all these classes except MTH 240). It felt like a shame to let these notes rot in a landfill, so I'm sharing them publicly in case they can be helpful to someone else too -- content-wise or as inspiration for how to structure study notes.

A caveat: they're mostly handwritten - no time to type them up sorry - but I think they're legible enough!
